# weather-display
An elaborate weather display website for seaside leisure enthusiasts

This project centers around a website that will generate a variety of dynamic weather reports to help its visitors know when and where they may want to do water or air activities.  It will allow users of the site to register for an account so they can have weather reports sent regularly through email or RSS.

The approach is to host a website using Apache, with PHP support for server-side scripting, MySQL for handling the database, which will be maintained with Python scripts that collect data from online sources.

CodeIgniter is used as a PHP framework, which provides a model-view-controller paradigm to the website
